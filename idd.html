                    <p>We will advise and make a recommendation for you after we have assessed your needs through our **Operational Intelligence** protocols. We act as a credit broker, not a lender. Our role is to pre-vet your financial data to ensure application success and introduce you to suitable lenders.</p>

                    <p>For our **Compliance Labs** services, we charge a fixed monthly recurring fee as outlined in your engagement letter. For **Capital Placement** (Brokerage), we do not typically charge you a direct fee; however, we will receive a commission or payment from the lender should you decide to enter into an agreement with them. The amount of commission varies by lender and product.</p>
